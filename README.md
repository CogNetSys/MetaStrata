Updates
- Pydantic AI - Brought code up-to-date with the latest version from pydantic called pydantic_ai. It's fantastic.
- Implemented WebSocket Server
- External Settings file (config.py) 
- Created World Management Interface with /reset, /initialize, /step, and /stop.
- Setup FastAPI, SwaggerUI, uvicorn as a local development environment.
- ~Nov.15th, 2024. Implemented Takata et al. barebones without the visualizations or analysis in JavaScript. Used Cloudflare worker to host the app, Supabase PostGres Database with Upstash Redis for cache, Groq cloud for the LLM. I watched a video on the "Discover AI" YouTube channel called, "AI Agents Create a New World - MBTI Personalities". It inspired me to immediately implement the idea for experimentation.
