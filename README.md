### Additional Endpoints and Techniques for Comprehensive Analysis

    Behavior Clustering Visualizations:
        Use clustering techniques (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN) to group agents based on behavior or states.
        Visualize the clusters in a 2D or 3D plot.

    Real-time Dashboards:
        Create a dynamic visualization to monitor agent metrics in real time.
        Include agent states, average interactions, resource utilization, etc.

    Outcome Heatmaps:
        Show where certain outcomes (e.g., successful tasks) occur.
        Overlay success rates or key results on the environment map.

    Flow Charts or Decision Trees:
        Visualize decision-making processes or agent states.
        Helps in understanding how agents transition between states.

    Diversity Metrics Visualization:
        Plot diversity in agent strategies, goals, or actions over time.
        Use bar charts, radar plots, or heatmaps.

    Communication Density Heatmaps:
        Show areas or times where communication between agents is dense.

    Efficiency Graphs:
        Compare the actual efficiency of agents (e.g., resource collection or task completion) against theoretical optima.

    Conflict/Collision Maps:
        Highlight areas or times where agents collide or conflict over resources.

    3D Spatial Visualization:
        If agents operate in a 3D environment, use a 3D plot to show movements or key dynamics.

    Performance Comparison Plots:
        Compare different agent strategies, initializations, or parameters across runs.

### Analysis Techniques

    - **Agent-Level Statistics:**
        - Compute average, max, and min metrics per agent.
        - Example: Number of tasks completed, time spent idle.

    - **System-Level Metrics:**
        - Aggregate measures such as total task completion time, global energy efficiency, or collective success rate.

    - **Correlation Analysis:**
        - Analyze relationships between agent actions, outcomes, and system performance.
        - Example: Correlation between communication frequency and task success.

    - **Divergence Metrics:**
        - Use measures like Jensen-Shannon divergence or entropy to assess behavioral variance across agents.

    - **Graph Analysis for Interactions:**
        - Compute network metrics (e.g., degree centrality, clustering coefficient) for the interaction graph.

    - **Sensitivity Analysis:**
        - Examine how changes in parameters (e.g., communication range, task density) affect system performance.

Updates
- Pydantic AI - Brought code up-to-date with the latest version from pydantic called pydantic_ai. It's fantastic.
- Implemented WebSocket Server for streaming real-time logs, updates, and information.
- External Settings file (config.py) 
- Created Entity Management API with /entities/~, various utility functions, and settings APIs.
- Created World Management Interface with /reset, /initialize, /step, and /stop.
- Setup FastAPI, SwaggerUI, uvicorn as a local development environment.
- ~Nov. 22nd, 2024. Migrated to Vercel from Cloudflare.
- ~Nov.15th, 2024. Implemented Takata et al. barebones without the visualizations or analysis in JavaScript. Used Cloudflare worker to host the app, Supabase PostGres Database with Upstash Redis for cache, Groq cloud for the LLM. I watched a video on the "Discover AI" YouTube channel called, "AI Agents Create a New World - MBTI Personalities". It inspired me to immediately implement the idea for experimentation.
