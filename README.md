Got it! Here’s a math problem where the agents need to collaborate using all three parts to solve for x:

The agents receive the following clues:

Clue 1: The sum of squares, 
𝑠
2
+
𝑠
2
+
𝑠
2
=
23
s 
2
 +s 
2
 +s 
2
 =23
Clue 2: Multiply the sum by 
44
𝑥
44x, i.e., 
(
𝑠
2
+
𝑠
2
+
𝑠
2
)
×
44
𝑥
=
𝑎
(s 
2
 +s 
2
 +s 
2
 )×44x=a
Clue 3: 
𝑎
=
40
a=40
To solve for x, the agents first need to figure out s from Clue 1, which simplifies to 
3
𝑠
2
=
23
3s 
2
 =23. Once they know s, they move on to Clue 2 to substitute the value of 
(
𝑠
2
+
𝑠
2
+
𝑠
2
)
(s 
2
 +s 
2
 +s 
2
 ) and solve for x in the equation 
23
×
44
𝑥
=
40
23×44x=40, giving them the value of x.
