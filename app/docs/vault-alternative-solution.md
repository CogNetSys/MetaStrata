# **Ultimate Solution for Competing with Vault (including custom code)**

1. **Secrets Management**:
   - Use **Doppler** for general environment secrets management and integration with cloud services.
   - Add **HashiCorp Vault** for dynamic secrets (database credentials, cloud credentials) and fine-grained access control.
   - Use **AWS Secrets Manager** for cloud-native secrets storage, especially for AWS services.

2. **Certificate Management**:
   - Keep **Smallstep** for managing **PKI**, certificate generation, signing, and automated rotations.
   - Use **Cert-Manager** for Kubernetes-based environments to automate certificate renewals.

3. **Access Control**:
   - Use **Keycloak** for centralized **identity and access management** across systems, ensuring only authorized users/services can access secrets and certificates.
   - Implement **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** for fine-grained, flexible access control.

4. **Auditing and Monitoring**:
   - Use the **ELK stack** or **Prometheus & Grafana** for **centralized auditing and monitoring** of secret usage, certificate access, and system health.
   - Ensure all actions are logged and monitored in real-time.

5. **Automated Rotation and Expiry**:
   - Implement **automated secret and certificate rotation** using tools like **Vaultâ€™s dynamic secrets engine** or **Cert-Manager**.
   - Develop custom scripts or use Terraform/Ansible to handle secret and certificate expiration and rotation across all systems.

6. **Custom Integrations**:
   - Write custom automation scripts for integration between **Smallstep**, **Doppler**, **Vault**, and **KMS** solutions, using **Terraform**, **Ansible**, or custom API calls for efficient management.

### Summary of the Ultimate Solution:
- **Certificate Management**: **Smallstep** for PKI, integrated with **Cert-Manager** for Kubernetes.
- **Secrets Management**: **Doppler** for environment variables, **Vault** for dynamic secrets, and **AWS Secrets Manager** for cloud-native secrets.
- **Access Control**: **Keycloak** for centralized identity and role management, **OPA** for fine-grained policies.
- **Audit and Monitoring**: Use **ELK stack** for centralized logging and **Prometheus/Grafana** for monitoring secret usage.
- **Automation**: Use **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and **CI/CD pipelines** for managing secrets, certificates, and rotation.

This solution, combining **commercial** and **open-source** tools, would provide a **comprehensive secrets management** solution with **dynamic secrets**, **certificate management**, **fine-grained access control**, and **real-time auditing**, essentially competing with or even exceeding **Vault** in certain areas like Kubernetes integration and ease of use.
